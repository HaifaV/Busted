Project Description
Busted is a browser extension that identifies movies based on their audio. It transcribes the audio, processes the transcript, and matches it against a movie dialogue database to provide accurate identification.

The Problem Statement
Ever wondered which movie a particular dialogue comes from while watching a clip? It's frustrating to recall or search for the movie, especially with limited context.

The Solution
Busted solves this by identifying the movie from the audio dialogue, using transcription and a dialogue database. Just click, record, and get results instantly!
